This archive contains all files necessary to produce the language dependent files
of AMouse.

There are three directories:
- Resource: contains all files necessary to produce the DLL containing the panels
            and other language dependent resources of AMouse. They all reside in
            single DLL, called AMouXXX.dll, where XXX is the country code.
            After compiling (rc.exe -r amoures.rc amoures.res), it
            has to be added to amoudll.dll (rc.exe amoures.res amoudll.dll).

- Help:     contains all files necessary to create the help file. There is only a
            single help file for all parts of AMouse. It is named AMouXXX.hlp,
            where XXX is the country code.
            Please note, that we are using IPFCPREP as a preprocessor for IPF
            files to be able to use symbolic panel ids.

- Install:  contains all files necessary to create the installation program. As
            the language of the installer is independent from the AMouse package
            itself, it has not necessarily to be translated to create a new
            language version of AMouse.

The main directory contains additional header files common to the language
dependent directories (and of course of the rest of our code...).
